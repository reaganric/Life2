<blockquote>

<i>~The Matrix</i> 
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>"Look deep into nature, and then you will understand everything better."</p>
<i>~Albert Einstein</i>

<blockquote>
<p>"A bored mind can be the canva upon which innovation is painted, and the womb in which novelty is nourished."</p>
<i>~<a href="https://www.daiyom.com/misc/mt.html"title="Go to Madison Taylor's profile page" target="_blank">Madisyn Taylor</a></i>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>"Follow your bliss.
 If you do follow your bliss,
 you put yourself on a kind of track
 that has been there all the while waiting for you 
and the life you ought to be living
is the one you are living.
when you can see that,
you begin to meet people
who are in the field of your bliss,
and they open the doors to you.
I say, follow your bliss and don't be afraid,
and doors will open 
where you didn't know they were going to be.
If you follow your bliss,
doors will open for you that wouldn't have opened
for anyone else."</p>
<i>~Joseph Campbell</i>
</blockquote>
<blockquote> 
<p>"Healers are Spiritual Warriors who have found the
 courage to defeat the darkness of the souls.
Awakening and rising from the depth of their 
deepest fears, like a Phoenix rising from the ashes.
Reborn with a wisdom and strength that creates a 
light that shine bright enough to help, encourage,
and inspire others out of their own darkness."</p>
<i>~Melanie Koulouris</i>  
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>"We are doughters and son of this Universal.
And, We are Universal Ourselves.Distinct Divine 
Souls who have dared to become human.We Make
True Love Whole.</p>
