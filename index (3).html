There are so many benefits of humming, you can literally heal any illness with just intention and humming. This book has helped me out so much on my journey of healing and transformation. I use humming to warm up to my singing and speaking and I also combine humming techniques with voice exercises to gradually open up my natural voice. I've explored many healing techniques during my journey of reconnecting with my true self and I found humming to be of the most effective and gentle ways to heal yourself.
